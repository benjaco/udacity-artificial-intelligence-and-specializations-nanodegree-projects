# Udacity artificial intelligence and specializations nanodegree projects

In this nanodegree, i took their special track for people there previously have taken an AI nanoderee at Udacity, that let me take the base course for the ai nanodree program and do all 3 specialties at once.

### Core projects:

**Suduku solver**

Make a program there can solve any suduku pussle with algortihm improvements like the naked twins algoritm - see ``sudoku``.


**Game agent**

Make a game agent there could play turn based games by trying move staticly by trying out moves with min-max pruning and evaluating them with a simple huristic. The game was based on a chess bord with 2 hourses, each player takes turn, and each cell can only by touched once - see ``gameplaying-agent``.


**Independent planer**

Creating an independent planer with takes in a starting state, a goal, all the actions there can be executed in the domain there effect the state, from here, the program should be able to solve any planning poroblem. The project was based on moving air cargo between airports in the most efficece mannar - see ``planning-search``.


**ASL recognize**

Recognize words from American Sign Language based on the location of the persons hands using a set of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) - see ``sign-language-recognizer``.


### Specialty projects:

**Facial Keypoint Detection**

Using Haar Cascade Classifier and a Convolutional Neural Network to detect facial keypoint to blur out faces and put on glasses - see ``specialty-computer-vision-capstone-project``.


**Machine translation**

Using a Bidirectional RNN with word embeddings, we translated sentences from English into France with a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline - see ``specialty-machine-translation-capstone-project``.


**DNN Speech Recognizer**
The last project was a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) pipeline - see ``specialty-speech-recognizer``
