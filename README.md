# Udacity artificial intelligence and specializations nanodegree projects

In this nanodegree, I took their special track for people there previously have taken an AI nanodegree at Udacity, that let me take the base course for the ai nanodegree program and do all 3 specialties at once.

### Core projects:

**Suduku solver**

Make a program there can solve any sudoku puzzle with algorithm improvements like the naked twin's algorithm - see ``sudoku``.


**Game agent**

Make a game agent there could play turn-based games by trying to move strategically by trying out moves with min-max pruning and evaluating them with a simple heuristic. The game was based on a chessboard with 2 horses, each player takes a turn, and each cell can only be touched once - see ``gameplaying-agent``.


**Independent planer**

Creating an independent planer with takes in a starting state, a goal, all the actions there can be executed in the domain there effect the state, from here, the program should be able to solve any planning problem. The project was based on moving air cargo between airports in the most efficient manner - see ``planning-search``.


**ASL recognize**

Recognize words from American Sign Language based on the location of the person's hands using a set of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) - see ``sign-language-recognizer``.


### Specialty projects:

**Facial Keypoint Detection**

Using Haar Cascade Classifier and a Convolutional Neural Network to detect facial keypoint to blur out faces and put on glasses - see ``specialty-computer-vision-capstone-project``.


**Machine translation**

Using a Bidirectional RNN with word embeddings, we translated sentences from English into France with a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline - see ``specialty-machine-translation-capstone-project``.


**DNN Speech Recognizer**
The last project was a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) pipeline - see ``specialty-speech-recognizer``
